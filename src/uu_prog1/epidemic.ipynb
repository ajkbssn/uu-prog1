    "<li><p>The final goal is to use your simulator to work with the real world. Download <a href=\"worldmapCoarse.dat\">worldmapCoarse.dat</a> and load it to your initial grid by <code>grid = numpy.loadtxt('worldmap.dat', dtype=int, delimiter=',')</code>. Try to set an initial infection area, say <code>grid[10:12, 80:82] = INFECTED</code>, then simulate for 100 weeks. Use your snapshot functions to visualize the results.</p>\n",

    "<li><p>If everything works fine so far, download <a href=\"worldmap.dat\">worldmap.dat</a>, which is a much finer grid. Set some initial infections at different locations and try to tune all the parameters to see if you can get the whole world infected. An example is shown in the end of this project.</p>\n",
